## Overview

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection Project** applies **machine learning techniques** to identify fraudulent transactions. This project includes data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling using Python, helping financial institutions minimize fraud risks.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Cleans and prepares transaction datasets for fraud detection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies key trends and patterns in fraudulent transactions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements predictive algorithms for fraud detection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Project Files

### 1. `cdd.csv`
This dataset contains transaction details, including:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Amount**: Transaction value.
- **Time**: Timestamp of the transaction.
- **Location**: Geographical transaction data.
- **Fraud Label**: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

### 2. `main.py`
This script processes transaction data, builds a fraud detection model, and evaluates performance.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
  - Reads transaction data from `cdd.csv`.
  - Handles missing values and normalizes fields.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summarizes fraudulent transaction trends and customer spending patterns.
  - Generates visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps.

- **Fraud Detection Model**:
  - Uses **Random Forest** or **Logistic Regression** for fraud classification.
  - Splits data into training and testing sets.
  - Evaluates model accuracy and precision.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('cdd.csv')

# Data Cleaning
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop(columns=['Fraud Label'])
y = data['Fraud Label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Training fraud detection model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Model Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```
